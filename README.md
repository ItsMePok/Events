# Events
An add-on that allows you to create events based on real time

This is made for Minecraft version 1.21.50+

No Experimental Toggles are needed for this addon

## Plans:

- Pre-made Events that a Event manager can add/remove (or enable option for players to select on there own) 
- Icon customization (although you can already do this if adding event from another add-ons you can't do it from in-game)

  - there would be pre-made options & an option to define a texture path
